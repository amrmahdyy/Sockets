# Socket-programming
It is required that you use socket programming and multi-
threading/multi-processing techniques to make the following assignment

which is divided into multiple parts
1) Multi-threaded web server:
Your web server should accept incoming connection requests. It should
then look for the GET request and pick out the name of the requested
file. If the request is POST then it sends OK message and wait for the
uploaded file from the client. Note that a GET request from a real WWW
client may have several lines of optional information following the
GET. These optional lines, though, will be terminated by a blank line
(i.e., a line containing zero or more spaces, terminated by a ’\r\n’
(carriage return then line feed characters). Your server should first
print out the received command as well as any optional lines following
it (and preceding the empty line).
The server should then respond with the line, this is a very simple
version of the real HTTP reply message:
HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n
then in case of GET command only:
{data, data, ...., data}
\r\n

waiting for new requests from the same client. If the document is not
found (in case of GET), the server should respond with(as would a real
http server) :

HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found\r\n

Server Side Pseudo Code
while true: do
- Listen for connections
- Accept new connection from incoming client and delegate
it to worker
thread/process
- Parse HTTP/1.0 request and determine the command (GET or
POST)
- Determine if target file exists (in case of GET) and
return error otherwise
- Transmit contents of the file (reads from the file and
writes on the socket) (in case of
GET)
- Close the connection
end while
notes: you are required to handle GET, POST, and status 200, status
404, HTML files, TXT files, and png files. Which would you choose for
your implementation multi-threaded or multi-process? Justify.
2) HTTP Web Client
Your web client must read and parse a series of commands from an
input file. For this assignment, only the GET and POST commands are
required to be handled. The commands syntax should be as follows:

GET file-name host-name (port-number)
POST file-name host-name (port-number)

Note that the port number is optional. If it is not specified, use
the default HTTP port
number, 80. In response to the specified operation (GET or POST),
the client must open
a connection to an HTTP server on the specified host listening on
the specified (or default) port number. The receiver must display
the file and then store it in the local directory (i.e., the
directory from which the client or server program was run). The
client should shut down when reaching the end of the file.
Client Side Pseudocode
while more operation exists do
Create a TCP connection with the server
Wait for permission from the server
Send next requests to the server
Receives data from the server (in case of GET) or sends
data (in case of POST)
Close the connection
end while
note: your client program should use the reliable stream protocol
and the internet domain protocols.

3) HTTP 1.1
You are required to add simple HTTP/1.1 support to your web server,
consisting of persistent connections and pipelining of client requests
to your web browser. You will also need to add some heuristic to your
webserver to determine when it will close a "persistent" connection.
That is after the results of a single request are returned (e.g.,
index.html), the server should
by default leave the connection open for some period of time, allowing
the client to reuse that connection to make subsequent requests. This
timeout needs to be configured in the server and ideally should be
dynamic based on the number of other active connections the server is
currently supporting. That is, if the server is idle, it can afford to
leave the connection open for a relatively long period of time. If the
server is busy, it may not be able to afford to have an idle
connection sitting around (consuming kernel/thread resources) for very
long.

4) bonus

Add a simple in place client side caching functionality to your
client. You do not need to implement any replacement or
validation policies. Your implementation, however, will need to
be able to write responses to the disk (i.e., the cache) and
fetch them from the disk when you get a cache hit. For this, you
need to implement some internal data structure in your client to
keep track of which objects are cached and where they are on the
disk. You can keep this data structure in the main memory; there
is no need to make it persist across shutdowns.

Teams of three
Your code must support bash arguments.
